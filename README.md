Data ALM for Dynamics 365 Finance Operations

# Update 2024 :
PLEASE INSTALL latest one : 1.0.0.7 Solution on Dataverse. You can add enhancements needed or track issues also here. 
Several options I had in my mind : Add Key Vault to secure it, and add environment variables too.
Though, with the ODOP and Unified Dev Environment coming, I think this will be the end at some point (using PAC CLI / PPAC & Power Platform & not anymore LCS API), check that : https://www.powerazure365.com/blog-1/dynamics-365-finops-unified-developer-experience
